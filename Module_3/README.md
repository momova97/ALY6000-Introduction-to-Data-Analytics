# Executive Summary Report 3

## Overview and Rationale

This assignment was an opportunity to further develop my data analytics skills, focusing on calculating probabilities, graphing probability distributions, and interpreting data using R.

## Module Objectives

The objectives of this assignment were to:

- Calculate counts and probabilities based on categorical data.
- Graph probability distributions.
- Manipulate datasets using R.
- Interpret data displayed in graphs.

## Assignment Summary

The assignment involved analyzing the `inchBio.csv` dataset and creating an executive summary that included:

- An introduction and methodology section.
- Key findings about the data, supported by R console screen snippets.
- At least three visualizations, including a mandatory pareto plot, to highlight key data characteristics.
- A concise summary paragraph outlining the main takeaways from the analysis.

## Key Findings and R Script Execution

Through this assignment, I learned to:

- Import and manipulate data in R, including filtering and creating subsets.
- Calculate and display counts and percentages for categorical data.
- Create various plots, including barplots and pareto plots, and customize their features.
- Interpret and explain the significance of the visualizations created.

## Reflection

Completing this assignment has enhanced my ability to communicate complex data insights in a clear and concise manner. I've gained practical experience in using R for data manipulation and creating visualizations that can inform business decisions. The process of converting raw data into meaningful graphs and understanding their implications has been a valuable addition to my skill set as a data analyst.

# Module 6 Final Project

## Overview and Rationale

The final project for Module 6 involved analyzing a dataset of my choosing to ask and answer key business questions, as well as to interpret the results of the analysis.

## Module Outcomes

The project allowed me to:

- Investigate the impacts of big data on industry.
- Describe the evolution of big data.
- Analyze data to complete a data-rich and visually appealing report.

## Assignment Summary

The assignment was divided into three parts:

### Part I: Understanding the Data

- I summarized the data in a table and created visualizations such as bar charts and histograms.
- I interpreted the story told by the data, answering specific business questions and discussing any unusual values.
- I cleaned the data by removing out-of-range values and presented analyses both with and without these values.
- I identified additional questions and necessary attributes to answer them.

### Part II: Creating New Attributes

- I computed differences between variable values and created new variables based on the data.
- I calculated the mean and median for each of the new variables.

### Part III: Reflections and Observations

- I reflected on what the data revealed about the attributes and formulated follow-up questions.
- I identified 3-5 observations or follow-up questions that arose from my analysis.

## Reflection

This project was a comprehensive exercise in data analytics, from cleaning and preparing the data to extracting meaningful insights. Through the process, I learned the importance of asking the right questions and the power of visual storytelling in data presentation. The ability to clean data and create new variables that provide deeper insights was particularly valuable.

As I conclude this project, I am reminded of the iterative nature of data analysis. Each step in the process builds upon the previous one, leading to more refined questions and more targeted analyses. The skills I've honed during this project, such as data manipulation in R and creating compelling visualizations, will be invaluable in my future role as a data analyst.

In presenting my findings, I aimed to make the data accessible and engaging. The challenge of distilling complex information into clear, concise visualizations is one that I have come to appreciate deeply. As I move forward in my career, I am excited to apply these skills to drive data-driven decision-making and to contribute to the strategic goals of an organization.
